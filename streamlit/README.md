## Description

I have made a Streamlit-based web app and it is deployed in Streamlit Cloud. You can test the [app here](https://itsmesamrat-rawdatatopredectivemodel--streamlitstreamlit-yh0n7p.streamlit.app/). You also have some data in the directory that will help you to test the model.

For the deployment, we have used Streamlit because it is quick and easy to make a web app based on streamlit and we can freely host our app in Streamlit Cloud. Hosting played an important role in my case.
